## What is a PIV Card?  
PIV stands for a "Personal Identity Verification" Credential. PIV cards are used government-wide to control access to Federally Controlled Facilities and information systems at the appropriate security level.  

## Request a PIV Exemption  
If you do not have a PIV card yet or lost yours, you can request a PIV exemption by dialing:  
<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- tab:Off-site -->
Call (224)610-4357
<!-- tab:On-site -->
Call Extension x64357
<!-- tabs:end -->
`Note:`You will receive a username and password that will allow you to log into VA network resources.  

## Update PIV Credentials Remotely  
A new or reprinted PIV card has different credentials than the prior card and must be synchronized with government-furnished equipment to ensure continued access to the VA network.

End users are encouraged to bring their laptops to the PIV card issuing facility (PCIF) to connect to the network while on site—this is the easiest way to synchronize new credentials.

If, for some reason, you are unable to bring your GFE to your PIV pick-up appointment, follow these instructions to synchronize credentials remotely:

1. At the Windows Login Screen, locate the Two Monitors icon at the bottom right and click to select.    
`Note:` If the “Two Monitors” icon is not an option, you must return to the PCIF location for on-site support to sync the new PIV credentials and connect to the VA network.  

2. When Cisco AnyConnect VPN (RESCUE) opens, click Connect.  

3. Wait while the software connects.   
`Note:` If the connection does not occur within 30 seconds, you should restart your computer and try again.  

4. Once connected, you will be presented with a screen to enter your PIV personal identification number (PIN). Enter your PIV PIN and click OK.  

5. When the Cisco AnyConnect “terms of use” prompt displays, click Accept.  
`Important:` The “terms of use” screen displays for only a few seconds, so click Accept as soon as it displays. If the screen disappears, you must restart the connection process.  

6. Wait while Cisco AnyConnect VPN (RESCUE) completes the System Scan.  

7. Once the Cisco AnyConnect System Scan is complete, you will be granted access to the VA Network.  
`Note:` The prompt will indicate that it is “Connected” and “Compliant.”  
  
8. Once Cisco AnyConnect VPN is connected, enter your PIV PIN and log in to the workstation. If you see the Password prompt instead of the Smart card prompt, click Sign-in options and select the Card icon.  
`Note:` Logging in may take 3-5 minutes.  

## Sign a PDF Document with your PIV Card  
1. Make sure your PIV card is inserted in your card reader.  
   
2. Make sure you are opening the file in the Adobe Acrobat Reader and not a browser or Teams Messenger.  

3. Once all required fields are completed, click on the blue rectangle to sign.  

4. A sign popup window will appear, click sign.  

5. Another window will appear, prompting the user to save the document.  It is recommended it is saved using a different name.  
  a. The window will allow you to keep an electronic copy with your signature for your records  

6. Next, the user will be prompted to put in their PIV card number (usually 4-8 numeric characters long); then click ‘ok’.  

7. The document is now signed and ready for submission.  Note the date and time also appear as part of your PIV signature.
