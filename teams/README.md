## What is Teams  
Microsoft Teams is the ultimate messaging app for your organization—a workspace for real-time collaboration and communication, meetings, file and app sharing, and even the occasional emoji! All in one place, all in the open, all accessible to everyone.  

## Manage your device settings  
You can manage your device settings in Microsoft Teams (free), so your calls are always using the right microphone or camera.  

1. Sign in to Teams on your desktop and select Settings and more More options button.  

2. Select Settings Settings button  and then select Devices Devices button.  

3. From Devices, you can change:  
  a. Audio devices – by picking your primary audio device, Speaker, and Microphone from their dropdown menus  
  b. Automatically adjust mic sensitivity – to make sure you’re always heard  
  c. Noise suppression – can be set to Auto (Default), High, Low, or Off  
  d. Secondary ringer – rings another device for all incoming calls. The default is set to None, and the dropdown menu will list available devices for your secondary ringer  
  e. Camera – video devices will be listed in the dropdown menu
