## What is Active Directory?  
Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft directory service and database that helps organizations manage their IT infrastructure and network resources:  

AD allows administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources by storing information about users, computers, devices, applications, and more as objects. It also allows users to authenticate themselves to access resources and authorizes access for other users on the network. AD can help organizations streamline user management, enhance network security, and troubleshoot faster.  

## What is Group Policy in Active Directory?  
Group Policy is used to regulate user and computer configurations within Windows Active Directory (AD) domains. It is a policy-based approach that can be applied to the whole organization or selectively applied to certain departments or groups in organizations.
