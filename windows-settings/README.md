## What are Microsoft Windows Settings?  
Microsoft Windows Settings, also known as the Settings app or PC Settings, **allow users to adjust their preferences, configure the operating system, and manage connected devices**. Settings can be used to change many aspects of how Windows looks and functions, such as:
Desktop background, Internet settings, Screen resolution, Lock screen, Date and time, User accounts, and Privacy settings. 

To open the Settings app in Windows 10, users can click the Start button and select the gear icon. In Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1, users can open PC settings by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search, and entering PC settings in the search box. 

Users can also sync their Microsoft account with Windows so that changes made in Windows are also synced to their account.
