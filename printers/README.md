## Fixing a Hung Job in Print Queue
1. When you open up the print server/printer and go to cancel jobs and notice that one is still sitting there stuck at "deleting" at that moment the print spooler will need to be restarted.  

2. This is done by logging into the server (see desktop lead for information as IP's will not be listed here) going to the search menu and typing "services" then clicking "Print Spooler" and shutting it off.  

3. Once you turn it back on, give it a minute to initialize and the print job will disappear from the queue.  

``Note:`` If after this, it still isn't working as in the next test job gets stuck as well, restart the printer itself.
