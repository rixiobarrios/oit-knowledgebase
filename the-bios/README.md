## What is the BIOS?  
BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is **a type of firmware that's embedded in a computer's motherboard and is the first software to run when a computer starts up**. It's responsible for performing essential functions such as:
- System start-up: BIOS provides instructions to the computer on how to boot up
- Hardware initialization: BIOS identifies and configures hardware like the CPU, hard drive, and memory
- Data flow management: BIOS manages data flow between the operating system and attached devices
